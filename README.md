# Introduction
The Virometer-App is based on the [flutter](https://flutter.dev/) framework. <br>Because there are some mutations of the Corona-Virus the app is build modular so its easy to add mutations, viruses or regions.
The data for the german districts are from the [RKI-API](#API)

# Features
Here you can see the main functions of the app
- See all german districts
- Select as much as you want
- Your selections are permanently stored
- Look at the most important numbers:
  - 7 days incidence
  - total deaths
  - total cases
- IOS and Android compatible
